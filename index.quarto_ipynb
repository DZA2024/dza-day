The symposium will take place on the 4th of November 2024 in the Irish college in the beautiful city of Leuven, which is not only the birthplace of the world-renowned Stella Artois Brewery, but also the home of the oldest university (599 years) in the low countries.  \n",

        "\n",
        "We invite you to participate, either by presenting a poster or a presentation, with any subject covering zeolites (or related materials), their synthesis and uses, e.g. as a catalyst or adsorbent. For this, submissions are open until the 30th of september. Priority will be given to PhD student and postdoctoral talks. We look forward to hearing from you. \n",
