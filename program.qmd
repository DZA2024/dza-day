**Xiaodong Zou** is a full professor in structural chemistry at the Department of Materials and Environmental Chemistry at Stockholm University. She is a leading expert in crystallography and porous materials and one of the pioneers in electron crystallography. For more than 30 years, her group has been developing image- and diffraction-based methods and software for crystal structure determination. 

She is known as a leading expert in the structural analysis of novel porous materials, including zeolites, metal-organic frameworks, and covalent organic frameworks. She has received several prestigious awards and is a distinguished professor at the Swedish Research Council and a Wallenberg Scholar. 

She is also a Fellow of the Royal Chemical Society, an elected member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and an elected member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences.
